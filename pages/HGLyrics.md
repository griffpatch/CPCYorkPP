At all times
============

In the mountains of joy, in the valley of tears 
I will love you, I will trust you 
When the flame's burning bright, when I'm weary and dry 
I will love you, I will trust you 
You are my strength and you are my song giving me hope and guiding me on 

At all times I will sing of your greatness 
At all times I will sing of your love 
At all times I will sing of your faithfulness 
For your goodness remains and your love is the same at all times 

When your guidance is clear, when I can't see ahead 
I will love you, I will trust you 
In the summer of life, in the soul's darkest night 
I will love you, I will trust you


Majesty
=======

Here I am humbled by your Majesty
Covered by your grace so free
Here I am, knowing I'm a sinful man
Covered by the blood of the Lamb

Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine
Since you laid down your life
The greatest sacrifice

Majesty, Majesty
Your grace has found me just as I am
Empty handed, but alive in your hands
Majesty, Majesty
Forever I am changed by your love
In the presence of your Majesty

Here I am humbled by the love that you give
Forgiven so that I can forgive
Here I stand, knowing that I'm your desire
Sanctified by glory and fire

Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine
Since you laid down your life
The greatest sacrifice
Forever I am changed by Your love
In the beauty of Your Majesty
