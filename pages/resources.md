Our (Condensed) Prayer Ministry Guidelines
------------------------------------------
**AIM**
The aim of our guidelines is to provide a common framework for Prayer Ministry – which is prayer with the laying on of hands – so that we can provide a safe and consistently positive experience, for those who receive this ministry at Clifton Parish.
 
**WHY**
We want to be channels of God’s amazing grace and serve out of love and compassion (Mark 1:41) and we aim to minister:
+	In obedience to THE FATHER (John 3:16; Galatians 4:4-8)
+	As servants of THE SON (Jesus), modelling ourselves on him and helping others find encouragement, forgiveness and healing in him (Mark 10:45)
+	In the power of the HOLY SPIRIT as we welcome his presence, trust in his guidance and use his gifts (Acts 1:8; 1 Corinthians 12:7)
+	

**HOW**
+	We will respect your dignity
+	Should we lay hands on you we will always ask your permission first and it's no problem if you say no
+	We will be able to annoit you with oil if you would like us to
+	We will have a bible nearby ready to share Scripture should something come to mind
+	We will share any words, pictures, prophecies that we believe God is encouraging you with and you will be allowed to weigh/judge them
+	We will guard confidentiality (NB. If there is any safeguarding issue we have a legal responsibility to share it with church leadership)
+	We will NOT stray into counselling; pray loudly in tongues; or advise/suggest/hint any discontinuation of medical treatment or medicine
+	We will not give directives about jobs, marriage, births or deaths
+	We will not give teaching

Our guidelines to weighing prophecy 
-----------------------------------
We believe that true prophesy originates in the heart of God. 
We believe that we must all test prophecy & judging prophecy is a collective responsibility (1 John 4:1; 1 Cor14:29) 
We believe we can test prophecy by discerning “the spirit behind prophesy” (1 John 4:1) by the gift of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor12:10) & through training (Hebrews 5:14).
 
We’ll know a prophecy is from God because:
+	He is always motivated by love (1 John 4:8)
+	The things God says are always good (Psalm 136:1; Luke 18:19; Mark 10:18)
+	The things God says are always perfect (Psalm 18:30)
+	His words are always consistent with Scripture  (Acts 17:11)
+	His words are strengthening, encouraging and/or comforting (1 Corinthians 14:3) 
+	His words bring life & healing (John 10:10, Exodus 15:26)
+	His words build up (1 Corinthians 14:12; Acts 20:32); 
+	His words instruct (1 Corinthians 14:31, Psalm 23:3-4), 
+	His words bear good fruit (Galatians 5:22-23, Matthew 7:15-20) 
+	His words will draw people closer to Himself (Jeremiah 31:3; 1 Corinthians 14:24-25); 
+	His words bring harmony & peace (Hebrews 13:17, 1 Corinthians 14:33; John 14:27)
+	His words will never limit your freedom nor will He over-rule your will (Galatians 5:1)
+	His words will testify to JESUS and will rely on what Jesus has done (Revelation 19:10)
+	His words carry Grace (Acts 20:32, John 1:16-17) 
+	His words will resonate (carry truth) and the Holy Spirit will testify to it (Romans 8:16) 
+	God is completely satisfied with the price Jesus paid at the Cross (1 John 2:2) so God is not angry, impatient, sin focused or punishment orientated
