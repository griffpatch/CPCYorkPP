**Prayer ministry Training Saturday October 1st in the Belfrey hall from 9.30am -1pm**

Run by St Michael le Belfrey, a training morning for all those in Prayer Ministry. The title for the morning is “Made in the image of God” and our speaker is Rev Mary Jobling who is a Fresh Expressions curate from Scarborough. The event comprises two sessions: “Praying out my identity in God” and "Praying out someone else’s identity in God”. There will be time to worship, have Q & A , and the opportunity to pray together. All are welcome. Please let mits know if you are intending to go (to pass rough numbers on so they have enough tea/coffee available!!) and NB. There will be no PIP on this morning.


For anybody interested in growing in Prayer/Prophecy (we hope these help):

Exploring Prayer
----------------
Most people have prayed at some stage in their life.  It might have been in a crisis (please God make them better), it might have been a bit of a bargaining tool (please God if you get me out of this I’ll….) or it might have been a rush of gratitude (wow the baby has arrived safely- thank you God).  We were made to be in relationship with one another and with our creator God.  But quite often we can get into patterns in our relationships that help us initially but then we can get into a rut.  The same happens in prayer.  

When we were younger we may have been introduced to a way of praying.  “Thank you God for mummy and daddy and for my friends.  Please help all those children who don’t have enough to eat. Amen.”  This is appropriate and helps children become aware of a loving father God but if our prayer remains at the same level we soon dry up.  Like any relationship it becomes deeper when we share ourselves and when we listen to the other.  

As people journey on in both years and in faith it is not uncommon to experience times when prayer is hard or doesn’t happen at all.  We often feel a lingering guilt because we only tend to pray when in need.  We imagine everyone else has a wonderful prayer life!  Just as we find new ways in our earthly relationships to connect so we can with God.  There are a number of resources available and on line sites as well, which can help you explore prayer (see below). Here are some other suggestions you may like to try out.

**A prayer walk**
Doing something that occupies our restless bodies frees us up to use our thinking more.  It might be better to walk either a very familiar route or one that doesn’t have too many roads to cross!  The ideas being that you don’t have to constantly be looking out for danger as that then pre-occupies our thinking. As you walk let a steady breathing rhythm develop.  Start by noticing what is around you and give thanks. Then have a conversation with God.  How has your day/week been? Where do you need help or who needs God’s presence today?

**Write your own psalm**
One of the things that stop a lot of people from praying is because they have a lot of uncomfortable or negative feelings.  They often feel bad and don’t feel God will be interested or that they have failed in some ways. Have a look at Psalm 69- you are not alone! Writing things down helps to bring a wider perspective and it gives more space for God to speak to you. Don’t be afraid of writing anything- God has heard it all and longs to bring you closer.

**Using pictures and objects**
Sometimes our words dry up.  We feel a void.  We don’t know how to start.  Many of the mystics stopped using words and just sat in the presence of God.  It is our desire to connect that God welcomes.  In these times using pictures (any ones even newspaper clippings) or icons and objects such as stones, flowers, a holding cross or indeed anything can be a way of reaching out. One young woman told me prayer was so hard she could only manage 3 words.  They were “angry, frustrated, lonely”.  She asked God for 3 words back.  She heard “Jesus-here-now”.

**Using art and creative media**
We have been trained through our education to use the left hand side of our brain, which is good for language and analytic skills.  But our feelings (which develop before language) are more at home in our right hand side of our brain.  It can be hard to express these in prayer or even know quite what it is we are experiencing.  Using any art materials (pastels, pencils, paint, clay etc) to make a mark or express how it is right now can be a start.  This is not about making a work of art! This is about expressing ourselves and then talking to God about it.  Someone found herself drawing a big colourful circle and a small black dot outside the circle.  She realized she felt alone but also envious of everyone else who she imagined to be having a fabulous time. She talked to God about that.

**Breakfast with God**
Or any meal! We have a good example of this when the risen Christ welcomed the disciples to breakfast on the beach.  We are a café culture nowadays and enjoy sitting with friends over a drink and sharing what’s been going on.  We can do the same with God.  Find a place where you wont have interruptions. The ritual of having a drink helps to regulate and settle us.  Chat to God about your day.  Are there challenges that day, is there too much space alone, are you too busy, what do you fear?  As you share these concerns allow the risen Christ to nourish you and prepare you for the day ahead.

**Using music**
Like art, music reaches parts of us that language struggles with. We all have favourite hymns and songs, which we can use as a springboard to talking to God. Sometimes we may just want to play a song or piece of music and let that be our prayer or we may want to sing along with a worship song. We may like to get up and dance!  The important thing is that we are doing this together.  We share the space and time with God.  God hears our desire to be closer and God who loves you will meet you in that space.

**Here are some suggestions for using online resources:**

http://www.sacredspace.ie/daily-prayer  This is a site put together by the Jesuits.  It offers a mini act of worship everyday which can also be printed out.

https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/join-us-in-daily-prayer.aspx  This is the Church of England site which enables you to pray a daily office.

https://cac.org/sign-up/ This is a site you can sign up to receive daily reflections.  These are written by Richard Rohr, a Franciscan monk, who offers some thoughtful insights to our faith journey. 

http://www.northumbriacommunity.org/offices/how-to-use-daily-office/  These prayers arise from the Northumbria community and reflect a Celtic history and approach in a modern way.
