Our condensed guidelines to weighing prophecy 
---------------------------------------------
We believe that true prophesy originates in the heart of God. 
We believe that we must all test prophecy & judging prophecy is a collective responsibility (1 John 4:1; 1 Cor14:29) 
We believe we can test prophecy by discerning “the spirit behind prophesy” (1 John 4:1) by the gift of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor12:10) & through training (Hebrews 5:14).
 
We’ll know a prophecy is from God because:
+	He is always motivated by love (1 John 4:8)
+	The things God says are always good (Psalm 136:1; Luke 18:19; Mark 10:18)
+	The things God says are always perfect (Psalm 18:30)
+	His words are always consistent with Scripture  (Acts 17:11)
+	His words are strengthening, encouraging and/or comforting (1 Corinthians 14:3) 
+	His words bring life & healing (John 10:10, Exodus 15:26)
+	His words build up (1 Corinthians 14:12; Acts 20:32); 
+	His words instruct (1 Corinthians 14:31, Psalm 23:3-4), 
+	His words bear good fruit (Galatians 5:22-23, Matthew 7:15-20) 
+	His words will draw people closer to Himself (Jeremiah 31:3; 1 Corinthians 14:24-25); 
+	His words bring harmony & peace (Hebrews 13:17, 1 Corinthians 14:33; John 14:27)
+	His words will never limit your freedom nor will He over-rule your will (Galatians 5:1)
+	His words will testify to JESUS and will rely on what Jesus has done (Revelation 19:10)
+	His words carry Grace (Acts 20:32, John 1:16-17) 
+	His words will resonate (carry truth) and the Holy Spirit will testify to it (Romans 8:16) 
+	God is completely satisfied with the price Jesus paid at the Cross (1 John 2:2) so God is not angry, impatient, sin focused or punishment orientated
