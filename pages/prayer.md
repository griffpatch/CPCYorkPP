Prayer
======

Our values
----------

We believe that prayer is simply talking with God. And we believe prayer is the start of everything.

If you need prayer
------------------

+	**Prayer Chain:** If you, or anybody you know, needs prayer you can be added to our Prayer Chain where members of our church will pray for you. Please do ask permission if you are intending to place somebody else other than yourself on the prayer chain, as requests are emailed and phoned out with brief details. 

+	**Prayer ministry:** After our 11am Family Service at CPC we offer prayer ministry, which is a prayer of blessing over you through the laying on of hands. This is done confidentially with as much privacy as possible. There is no need for you to share anything in any depth, although we will always ask if there is anything in particular you would like prayer for. Everybody is welcome for prayer, even if it’s just to have a blessing. There will always be two of us who have been trained in prayer ministry, who will pray blessing over you and if needed, you can be anointed with holy oil. Please note, that this is not a counselling ministry (for counselling please contact: David Casswell <davecasswell@gmail.com> or The Spuriergate Centre)

+	**Anoiting ministry:** At our Communion Services we offer Annoiting with oil. Do come up for this blessing when directed.

+	**SOZO ministry:** SOZO is an inner healing and deliverance ministry (with sessions usually lasting between 1-1.5 hours). Although we do not offer this Ministry within Clifton Parish, this ministry is available for all church-goers from 2017 at the York House of Prayer (YHoP). Please see the YHoP website for more info: <http://www.yhop.co.uk/>

Our condensed Prayer Ministry Guidelines
----------------------------------------
**AIM**

The aim of our guidelines is to provide a common framework for Prayer Ministry – which is prayer with the laying on of hands – so that we can provide a safe and consistently positive experience, for those who receive this ministry at Clifton Parish.
 
**WHY**

We want to be channels of God’s amazing grace and serve out of love and compassion (Mark 1:41) and we aim to minister:

+	In the LOVE of THE FATHER (John 3:16)
+	As ambassadors of THE SON (Jesus), modelling ourselves on him and helping others find encouragement, forgiveness and healing in Him (Mark 10:45)
+	In the power of the HOLY SPIRIT as we welcome His presence, trust in His guidance and use His gifts (Acts 1:8; 1 Corinthians 12:7)

**HOW**

+	We will love you 
+	We will respect your dignity and honour you
+	Should we lay hands on you we will always ask your permission first and it's no problem if you say no
+	We will be able to annoit you with oil if you would like us to
+	We will have a bible nearby ready to share Scripture should something come to mind
+	We will share any words, pictures, prophecies that we believe God is encouraging you with 
+	You will be free to weigh/judge all prophecy and parts of prophecy
+	We will guard confidentiality (NB. If there is any safeguarding issue we have a legal responsibility to share it with church leadership)
+	We will NOT stray into counselling; pray loudly in tongues; or advise/suggest/hint any discontinuation of medical treatment or medicine
+	We will not give directives about jobs, marriage, births or deaths
+	We will not give teaching 
+	We will always minister to you in pairs for accountability and safety

NB. Our full guidelines are posted in our secure resources area.
