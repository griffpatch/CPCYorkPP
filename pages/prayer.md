Prayer
======

Our values
----------

We believe that prayer is simply talking with God. And we believe prayer is the start of everything (Go through ideas with DC etc.)

If you need prayer
------------------

*	**Prayer Chain:** If you or anybody you know needs prayer, be added onto our Prayer Chain where we will pray for you (Intro, contact details)

*	**Prayer ministry:** After our 11am Family Service at CPC we offer prayer ministry, which is a prayer of blessing over you through the laying on of hands. This is done confidentially with as much privacy as possible. There is no need for you to share anything in any depth, although we will always ask if there is anything in particular you would like prayer for. Everybody is welcome for prayer, even if itâ€™s just to have a blessing. There will always be two of us who have been trained in prayer ministry, who will pray blessing over you and if needed, you can be anointed with holy oil. Please note, that this is not a counselling ministry (for counselling please contact: NAME CONTACT or Spuriergate)

*	**SOZO ministry:** SOZO is an inner healing and deliverance ministry (with sessions usually lasting between 1-1.5 hours). Although we do not offer this Ministry within Clifton Parish, this ministry is available for all church-goers from 2017 at the York House of Prayer (YHoP). Please see the YHoP website for more info: http://www.yhop.co.uk/
