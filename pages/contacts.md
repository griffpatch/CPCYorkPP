CPC Intercessions
-----------------

Intercession is prayer for other people – often people we don’t know and will never meet. In that way it is perhaps the most selfless form of prayer – but it’s prayer in which we have the privilege of sharing God’s heart and love and care for his world. On Sunday 17th July, 2016 I was in a church service – not in this parish – at the end of a week that had seen a new Prime Minister in the UK, a lorry being deliberately driven into crowds of people in France out celebrating a national holiday and an attempted coup in Turkey. And not a word was said about any of it in that service. Christians have a hope that the rest of the world doesn’t have. Prayer for the world is our gift to the world and there is power in this prayer. Justin Welby has said “When we pray, we are engaging with a God who changes history.” We are all called to the work of intercession, but if you feel it is something you could lead a congregation in on a Sunday morning at CPC or at St Mark’s Church, please email monicadunham@dsl.pipex.com or tel 07875-089487 to arrange to meet and talk though what’s involved.
