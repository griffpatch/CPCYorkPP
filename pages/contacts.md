The prayer chain is a way to inform people of prayer needs quickly. The requests are emailed and phoned out with brief details. Each person responds to the request in their own way and own time. In order to place someone on the prayer chain you must first ask their permission. Then the request is emailed or phoned to one of the staff or Margaret Horsely, details on info2go.



CPC Intercessions
-----------------

Intercession is prayer for other people – often people we don’t know and will never meet. In that way it is perhaps the most selfless form of prayer – but it’s prayer in which we have the privilege of sharing God’s heart and love and care for his world. On Sunday 17th July, 2016 I was in a church service – not in this parish – at the end of a week that had seen a new Prime Minister in the UK, a lorry being deliberately driven into crowds of people in France out celebrating a national holiday and an attempted coup in Turkey. And not a word was said about any of it in that service. Christians have a hope that the rest of the world doesn’t have. Prayer for the world is our gift to the world and there is power in this prayer. Justin Welby has said “When we pray, we are engaging with a God who changes history.” We are all called to the work of intercession, but if you feel it is something you could lead a congregation in on a Sunday morning at CPC or at St Mark’s Church, please email monicadunham@dsl.pipex.com or tel 07875-089487 to arrange to meet and talk through what’s involved.

Our Prayer ministry is predominantly a prayer of blessing over individuals through the laying on of hands. This is done confidentially and with as much honour and love as possible. This is not a counselling ministry and we are not permitted to give advice or councel. If you think you might like to join our Prayer Ministry Team at Clifton Parish, please do contact us and we can give you more info and train you up. We always work in pairs so you will never minister alone. In order to be part of our rota you will need to give us your term's availability in advance.
