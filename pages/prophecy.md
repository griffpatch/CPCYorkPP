Prophecy
========

What is prophecy
----------------

We believe in the gift of prophecy that comes from the Holy Spirit. It is the ability to receive revelation from God’s heart concerning another person: That He knows us, loves us, and has plans for us (Psalm 139; Jer31:3; Jer29:11). Because it is a gift it cannot be earnt and is not given as a reward and is not a sign of mature character or special favour. Every believer can ask for and receive this gift (1 Cor14:31; 1 Cor14:39). And we believe in the distinction between the gift of the Holy Spirit that is prophecy, and the gift of Christ, where a person has a calling to be a prophet and part of the church’s governmental structure of apostles, prophets, evangelists, teachers & pastors.

Our values
----------
*	We believe that the purpose of this gift is to minister LOVE, and that the Holy Spirit gives us this gift for the common good, to build up and edify the church, to instruct and encourage, to strengthen, exhort & comfort (1 Corinthians 12:7; 1 Corinthians 14:12; 1 Corinthians 14:5; 1 Corinthians 14:1; 1 Corinthians 14:31; 1 Corinthians 14:3)
*	We will believe that God loves to speak with us and loves to share His heart with us (Jeremiah 33:3)
*	We believe we must be free to prophesy and free to judge prophecy, in order to steward the gift well
*	We will weigh all prophecy and all parts of prophecy (the revelation, interpretation & application) 
*	We can weigh prophecy by testing the spirit behind prophecy 
*	We will honour and love one another (Romans 12:10, John 13:34)
*	We will submit to church leadership (Hebrews 13:17) and to one another (Ephesians 5:21) 
*	We will do things in an orderly way (1 Corinthians 14:40) 
*	We believe in the supernatural gift of the discernment of spirits (1 Corinthians 12:10) 
*	And we believe that it is possible to grow in discernment through training & practice (Hebrews 5:14)

Our condensed guidelines to weighing prophecy 
---------------------------------------------
We believe that true prophesy originates in the heart of God. 
We believe that we must all test prophecy & judging prophecy is a collective responsibility (1 John 4:1; 1 Cor14:29) 
We believe we can test prophecy by discerning “the spirit behind prophesy” (1 John 4:1) by the gift of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor12:10) & through training (Hebrews 5:14).
 
We’ll know a prophecy is from God because:
+	He is always motivated by love (1 John 4:8)
+	The things God says are always good (Psalm 136:1; Luke 18:19; Mark 10:18)
+	The things God says are always perfect (Psalm 18:30)
+	His words are always consistent with Scripture  (Acts 17:11)
+	His words are strengthening, encouraging and/or comforting (1 Corinthians 14:3) 
+	His words bring life & healing (John 10:10, Exodus 15:26)
+	His words build up (1 Corinthians 14:12; Acts 20:32); 
+	His words instruct (1 Corinthians 14:31, Psalm 23:3-4), 
+	His words bear good fruit (Galatians 5:22-23, Matthew 7:15-20) 
+	His words will draw people closer to Himself (Jeremiah 31:3; 1 Corinthians 14:24-25); 
+	His words bring harmony & peace (Hebrews 13:17, 1 Corinthians 14:33; John 14:27)
+	His words will never limit your freedom nor will He over-rule your will (Galatians 5:1)
+	His words will testify to JESUS and will rely on what Jesus has done (Revelation 19:10)
+	His words carry Grace (Acts 20:32, John 1:16-17) 
+	His words will resonate (carry truth) and the Holy Spirit will testify to it (Romans 8:16) 
+	God is completely satisfied with the price Jesus paid at the Cross (1 John 2:2) so God is not angry, impatient, sin focused or punishment orientated
