Prophecy
========

What is prophecy
----------------

We believe in the gift of prophecy that comes from the Holy Spirit. It is the ability to receive revelation from God’s heart concerning another person: That He knows us, loves us, and has plans for us (Psalm 139; Jer31:3; Jer29:11). Because it is a gift it cannot be earnt and is not given as a reward and is not a sign of mature character or special favour. Every believer can ask for and receive this gift (1 Cor14:31; 1 Cor14:39). And we believe in the distinction between the gift of the Holy Spirit that is prophecy, and the gift of Christ, where a person has a calling to be a prophet and part of the church’s governmental structure of apostles, prophets, evangelists, teachers & pastors.

Our values
----------
*	We believe that the purpose of this gift is to minister LOVE, and that the Holy Spirit gives us this gift for the common good, to build up and edify the church, to instruct and encourage, to strengthen, exhort & comfort (1 Corinthians 12:7; 1 Corinthians 14:12; 1 Corinthians 14:5; 1 Corinthians 14:1; 1 Corinthians 14:31; 1 Corinthians 14:3)
*	We will believe that God loves to speak with us and loves to share His heart with us (Jeremiah 33:3)
*	We believe we must be free to prophesy and free to judge prophecy, in order to steward the gift well
*	We will weigh all prophecy and all parts of prophecy (the revelation, interpretation & application) 
*	We can weigh prophecy by testing the spirit behind prophecy 
*	We will honour and love one another (Romans 12:10, John 13:34)
*	We will submit to church leadership (Hebrews 13:17) and to one another (Ephesians 5:21) 
*	We will do things in an orderly way (1 Corinthians 14:40)
